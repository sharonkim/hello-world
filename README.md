# hello-world

Hey there!

My family and I are originally from Hawaii, and we moved to NorCal in 2003...We miss home :(
I've been an office manager for practically my entire adult life and I've finally gotten fed up with being an overworked, underpaid slave.  My goal is to become a Software Developer so I can be an overworked, WELL-paid slave :P
